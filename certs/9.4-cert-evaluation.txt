Both certificates were evaluated using https://certlogik.com/decoder/

1. Self-signed certificate

This certificate is valid unti ldecember 2026. It does not use a weak key that
is on the certlogik's blacklist. The RSA key-size is 2048 which is secure. Its
weakness is the signature algorithm used, SHA-1, which is being phased out.

2. End-user certificate

This certificate is also valid unti ldecember 2026. It also does not use a weak
key that is on the certlogik's blacklist. The RSA key-size is 1024 which is is
not secure. Its other weakness is again the signature algorithm used, SHA-1,
which is being phased out.
